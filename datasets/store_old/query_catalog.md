# Query Catalog

Stable IDs shared by every engine. The pattern names match the folders in
[patterns/](../../reference/patterns/). Routes follow the
[route contract](../../lab/api/02_route_contract/README.md) (every route also
takes `db=`).

Per-engine fit is recorded in each unit's `06_queries/`:
✓ natural · ~ awkward · ✗ wrong tool (say why).

**Plan basics** (Q01, Q03, Q04, Q09, Q10) are taught in each unit's
`07_explain/`: point lookups, range scans, foreign-key lookups, and covering
indexes.

**Proposed:** Q16, search review text ([full_text_search](../../reference/patterns/full_text_search/)),
once the `reviews` table is added.

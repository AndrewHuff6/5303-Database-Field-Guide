# FINDINGS template

Copy the part between the lines below to `FINDINGS_<engine>.md`
(e.g. `FINDINGS_sqlite.md`) in your own repo, one file per unit, and fill it in.

Keep answers short: one to three sentences each. Every answer points at a
**number** from your results or a **plan line**. An answer without one is
an opinion.

### Plan summaries

The one or two plan lines that explain each query's time, in the largest
databases. Describe how the engine runs it, not what the query does.

| Query | `noidx_1m` plan | `idx_1m` plan |
| :---- | :-------------- | :------------ |
| Q01   |                 |               |
| ...   |                 |               |

### Questions

Answer whatever your unit's `07_explain/` asks for under *Your artifact*.

## Load (§8)

| Run | Scenario | n | settings | succeeded | failed | seconds | succeeded/sec | p95 ms |
| :-- | :------- | -: | :------- | --------: | -----: | ------: | ------------: | -----: |
|     |          |    |          |           |        |         |               |        |

### Questions

Copy the questions from your unit's `08_concurrency/` here and answer them.

## When to choose it (§9)

sentences, and one number from above.

1.
2.
3.

## One surprise

What did your numbers show that you didn't expect, and what explains it?

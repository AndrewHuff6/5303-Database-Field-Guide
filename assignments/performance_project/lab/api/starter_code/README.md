# Starter code: the measurement API

The `store` query catalog behind FastAPI, running on SQLite. Every route
returns the [result envelope](../02_route_contract/README.md): rows, plus how
long the database took and the plan it used.

Sixteen routes are written for you. **You write three: Q03, Q08, and Q15.**
Search `app/main.py` for `TODO`.

## Layout

```
starter_code/
├── pyproject.toml          dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, httpx (+ pytest)
├── .env.example            DATA_DIR, BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS
├── app/
│   ├── main.py             the routes, one per catalog row  <- your three go here
│   ├── experiment.py       ?db= selection, run_query(), run_write(), the envelope
│   └── models.py           NewPurchase, the JSON body for Q15
├── driver.py               calls every route on every database -> results/
└── tests/
    ├── conftest.py         builds a small temp database for the tests
    ├── test_smoke.py       passes out of the box
    └── test_your_routes.py fails until your three routes work
```

The SQL isn't in `main.py`. Each route loads its query from
[engines/01_sqlite/06_queries/](../../../engines/01_sqlite/06_queries/README.md),
so the `.sql` file is the only copy. Change the file, and the route changes.

## Setup

From the repo root:

```bash
python3 datasets/store/generator/make_dbs.py      # ~10 s: the six test databases

cd lab/api/starter_code
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/test_smoke.py -q                     # should pass before you start
```

Then write your three routes until this passes:

```bash
pytest tests/test_your_routes.py -v
```

## Run it

```bash
python -m app.main             # http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs
```

Try a route in the browser:
<http://127.0.0.1:8001/customers?customer_id=7&db=idx_1m>

In a second terminal, run the experiment:

```bash
python driver.py --sizes 10k   # quick check
python driver.py               # all six databases -> results/results.md
```

**Always run from this folder.** `python -m app.main` and
`uvicorn app.main:app --port 8001` both work. `python app/main.py` does not,
because the `app.` package-relative imports need the package context.

## Environment variables

**A program reads its environment variables once, when it starts, and no
other program sees them.** Where you set one decides how long it lasts:

| You type                                  | It applies to                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ENGINE=duckdb python -m app.main`        | that one command only                                  |
| `export ENGINE=duckdb`, then the command  | every command in **this terminal**, until you close it |
| `export ...` in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` | every **new** terminal                                 |

So a running API can't switch engines: stop it (Ctrl-C) and start it again
with the new setting. Each terminal is separate: an `export` in terminal 1
doesn't reach terminal 2. Nothing loads a `.env` file for you; see
[.env.example](.env.example) for how to load one by hand.

Which program reads which variable:

| Variable          | Default                                       |   API (`python -m app.main`)    | `driver.py` |     build scripts     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------: | :---------: | :-------------------: |
| `ENGINE`          | `sqlite` (or `duckdb`, `postgres`, `mongodb`) |                ✓                |      —      |           —           |
| `HOST`, `PORT`    | `127.0.0.1`, `8001`                           |                ✓                |      —      |           —           |
| `RELOAD`          | `1` (set `0` when measuring)                  |                ✓                |      —      |           —           |
| `DATA_DIR`        | `datasets/store/generated/sqlite/`            |                ✓                |      ✓      |           ✓           |
| `DUCKDB_DIR`      | the `duckdb/` folder next to `DATA_DIR`       |       ✓ (`ENGINE=duckdb`)       |      —      | ✓ (`build_duckdb.py`) |
| `FIELD_GUIDE`     | the clone this folder sits in                 |                ✓                |      ✓      |           —           |
| `BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000`                                        | ✓ (SQLite only; 08_concurrency) |      —      |           —           |

`FIELD_GUIDE` matters only when this folder has been copied into your own
repo: it says where to find `06_queries/` (the tests read it too). The
PostgreSQL and MongoDB harnesses add their own settings; each engine's
`07_explain/` lists them.

Two things in that table catch people:

- **The driver never reads `ENGINE`.** It doesn't know which engine answers.
  You choose the engine by which API you point it at, with `--base`.
- **The driver always reads the SQLite `.db` files**, even when it's
  measuring another engine. It uses them to choose the busiest customer and
  a deep purchase id, which are parameters for some queries. So `DATA_DIR`
  must be right in the driver's terminal too.

Set `DATA_DIR` once in your shell profile, as
`export DATA_DIR="$HOME/5303_data/sqlite"`. Use `$HOME`, not `~`: inside
quotes the shell doesn't expand `~`, and the API and the driver then can't
find the files. After that, `ENGINE` and `PORT` are the only variables you
type.

`RELOAD=0` when you measure: with reload on, the server restarts each time a
file changes, and a restart in the middle of a run throws the numbers off.

## Editor setup (VS Code / Pyright)

`app/` is a package, and its modules import each other **relatively**
(`from .experiment import run_query`). Don't let an "organize imports" action
rewrite these to `from experiment import ...`. That form resolves in the
editor but crashes at runtime with `ModuleNotFoundError`.

Select the `.venv` interpreter: Command Palette → *Python: Select Interpreter*
→ `./.venv`.
